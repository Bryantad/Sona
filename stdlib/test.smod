# test.smod
# Purpose: Lightweight testing helpers for stdlib modules (assertions, fixtures, runners).
# Inputs: closures/functions, expected values, descriptive messages, and fixture registries.
# Outputs: Structured assertion results and aggregated test outcomes.
# Errors: Will emit assertion failures with structured metadata once Result integration is wired.

# Asserts that two values are equal.
func assert_equal(actual, expected, message) {
    # TODO: implement equality assertion
}

# Asserts that a condition is true.
func assert_true(condition, message) {
    # TODO: implement boolean assertion
}

# Asserts that a condition is false.
func assert_false(condition, message) {
    # TODO: implement falsy assertion
}

# Asserts that a callable raises an error.
func assert_raises(block, message) {
    # TODO: implement exception assertion
}

# Registers a fixture factory by name.
func register_fixture(name, factory) {
    # TODO: implement fixture registration
}

# Retrieves a registered fixture.
func get_fixture(name) {
    # TODO: implement fixture lookup
}

# Runs a suite of test cases with setup/teardown hooks.
func run_suite(suite) {
    # TODO: implement simple test runner
