## Interface Comparison

| Feature        | Classic (Tkinter) | Modern (PySide6)    |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Availability   | ‚úÖ Always works   | ‚ö° Requires PySide6 |
| Performance    | Good              | Excellent           |
| Visual Design  | Standard          | Professional        |
| Responsiveness | Standard          | Smooth              |

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Basic Setup (Tkinter only)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bryantad/Sona.git
cd Sona
python launcher.py
```

### Option 2: Enhanced Setup (with modern UI)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bryantad/Sona.git
cd Sona
pip install PySide6
python launcher.py
```

### Option 3: Full Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bryantad/Sona.git
cd Sona
pip install -r requirements.txt
python launcher.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### GUI won't start

- **Check Python version**: Requires Python 3.8+
- **Check tkinter**: `python -m tkinter` should show a test window
- **Try fallback**: If modern UI fails, classic UI will start automatically

### PySide6 not working

```bash
# Reinstall PySide6
pip uninstall PySide6
pip install PySide6

# Test installation
python -c "from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication; print('PySide6 works!')"
```

### Examples not loading

- Ensure you're in the Sona directory when running `python launcher.py`
- Check that the `examples/` folder exists and contains `.sona` files

## Development

The GUI launcher consists of:

- `launcher.py` - Main entry point with auto-detection
- `gui/gui_launcher.py` - Classic Tkinter interface
- `gui/modern/launcher.py` - Modern PySide6 interface
- `run_gui.py` - Development launcher script
