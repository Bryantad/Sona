"""Quarantined experimental type-aware interpreter module.

The original implementation was syntactically corrupted beyond safe incremental
repair (multiple malformed inline statements, broken try/except blocks, and
mis-indented compound statements). For the 0.9.3 quality pass this module is
temporarily disabled to unblock linting and modernization of the active core.

Future restoration plan (target >=0.9.4):
1. Recreate a clean, test-driven type inference layer.
2. Re‑introduce an incremental TypeContext with clear public contracts.
3. Provide integration tests covering: assignment typing, function inference,
   arithmetic optimizations, and graceful degradation in non‑strict mode.

Accessing any attribute of this module will raise a RuntimeError with guidance.
