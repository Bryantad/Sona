# Sona Teaching Guide

**Complete curriculum for teaching Sona programming — ages 12–55, neurodivergent-friendly**

---

## 🎯 Who This Guide Is For

- **Teachers** introducing programming to beginners
- **Self-learners** working through Sona at their own pace
- **Parents** teaching kids to code
- **Mentors** working with neurodivergent learners (ADHD, autism, dyslexia)

This guide takes someone from **zero programming experience** to **confident Sona developer**.

## 🧠 Design Principles

### Neurodivergent-Friendly Approach

1. **Chunked Learning** — Small, focused lessons (10–15 min each)
2. **Visual First** — Diagrams before code when possible
3. **Immediate Feedback** — Every concept has runnable examples
4. **Multiple Explanations** — Same idea explained different ways
5. **No Assumptions** — Every term defined when introduced
6. **Clear Structure** — Predictable lesson format throughout
7. **Mini-Episodes** — 2–3 short deep-dives per topic for those who need more detail

### Lesson Format (Every Lesson)

```
📦 What You'll Learn (bullet list)
🎯 Why This Matters (real-world connection)
🧩 Core Concept (simple explanation + visual)
💻 Code Example (copy-paste ready)
🔬 Try It Yourself (guided exercise)
🧠 Common Mistakes (what to avoid)
✅ Checkpoint (self-test questions)
```

## 🚀 How to Use This Guide

### For Teachers

1. **Preview each module** before teaching
2. **Run all examples** to ensure they work in your environment
3. **Use mini-episodes** for students who need extra explanation
4. **Adjust pacing** — some learners may need 2x time on certain topics

### For Self-Learners

1. **Go in order** — later modules build on earlier ones
2. **Type the code yourself** — don't just copy-paste
3. **Do every exercise** — learning happens through doing
4. **Use mini-episodes** when something doesn't click

### For Neurodivergent Learners

1. **Take breaks** — 15 min learning, 5 min break works well
2. **Use the checkpoints** — they help confirm understanding
3. **Watch the mini-episodes** for alternative explanations
4. **It's okay to re-read** — repetition helps retention
