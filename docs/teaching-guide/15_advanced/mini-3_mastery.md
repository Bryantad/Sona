## Building Your Own Library

### Steps to Create a Sona Package

```
my-library/
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── setup.sona          # Package config
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.sona   # Main exports
│   ├── core.sona       # Core functionality
│   └── utils.sona      # Utilities
└── tests/
    └── test_core.sona  # Tests
```

### Example Library Structure

```sona
// src/__init__.sona
export {
    calculate,
    format,
    validate
} from "./core"

// src/core.sona
func calculate(data) {
    // Implementation
}

func format(value, options = {}) {
    // Implementation
}

func validate(input) {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Teaching Others

The best way to solidify knowledge: **teach it!**

### Ways to Teach
- Write blog posts
- Create YouTube tutorials
- Answer questions on forums
- Mentor beginners
- Give talks at meetups

### Teaching Tips
1. **Start simple** - Assume no prior knowledge
2. **Use examples** - Show, don't tell
3. **Be patient** - Everyone learns differently
4. **Encourage questions** - No question is dumb
5. **Celebrate progress** - Small wins matter

## Daily Coding Practice

### The 30-Minute Rule
Code for at least 30 minutes every day:

```
Week 1-2: Review basics, small exercises
Week 3-4: Build a small project
Week 5-6: Add features, refactor
Week 7-8: Start a new project
```

### Code Kata Ideas
1. Implement a data structure (Stack, Queue, Tree)
2. Solve an algorithm problem
3. Refactor old code
4. Add tests to existing code
5. Read and understand someone else's code
