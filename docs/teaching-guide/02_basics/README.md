# Module 02: Basics

**Learn to store and work with information in your programs.**

---

## 🎯 Module Goals

By the end of this module, you will:
- Create variables to store information
- Work with different types of data (text, numbers, true/false)
- Write expressions that calculate things
- Understand how Sona evaluates code

## 📚 Lessons in This Module

| # | Lesson | Duration | Description |
|---|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | [Variables](mini-1_variables.md) | 15 min | Storing and naming information |
| 2 | [Expressions](mini-2_expressions.md) | 15 min | Math and combining values |

## 🧠 Key Concepts Preview

- **Variable** = A named container for storing data
- **Data Type** = The kind of data (text, number, true/false)
- **Expression** = Code that calculates to a single value
- **Operator** = Symbols like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` that do operations

---

## 💡 Tips for This Module

### For Beginners
- Variables are like labeled boxes — you put stuff in them and take it out later
- Every value has a "type" — text behaves differently than numbers
- Experiment! Change values and see what happens

### For Neurodivergent Learners
- This module introduces a lot of new terms — that's normal
- Use the checkpoint questions to test yourself
- Refer back to this module often — these concepts are foundational
