## 🎯 Why This Matters

Every app on your phone, every website you visit, every game you play — they're all made with programming. Learning to code means you can:
- **Create things** that millions of people use
- **Solve problems** in ways others can't
- **Understand** how the digital world works
- **Build your ideas** into reality

## 🧩 Core Concept

### What is Programming?

**Programming is writing instructions for a computer.**

Think of it like a recipe:
- A recipe tells a chef what to do step by step
- A program tells a computer what to do step by step

```
Recipe (for humans)          Program (for computers)
───────────────────          ─────────────────────────
1. Get eggs                  1. Get user's name
2. Crack into bowl           2. Say "Hello" + name
3. Whisk until fluffy        3. Wait for response
4. Pour into pan             4. Show the answer
```

### What is Sona?

**Sona is a programming language designed to be easy to read and write.**

Here's what Sona code looks like:

```sona
print("Hello, world!")
```

That's it! One line, and your computer will display "Hello, world!" on the screen.

### Why Sona?

| Feature | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Clean syntax** | Code looks like English sentences |
| **Forgiving** | Makes helpful suggestions when you make mistakes |
| **Neurodivergent-friendly** | Designed with clear, predictable patterns |
| **Real power** | Can build actual applications, not just toy examples |

## 💻 Your First Look at Sona Code

Here's a simple program:

```sona
// This is a comment — the computer ignores it
// Comments are notes for humans reading the code

let name = "Alex"
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

**What each line does:**

1. `// This is a comment` — A note for humans (computer skips this)
2. `let name = "Alex"` — Create a container called `name` and put "Alex" in it
3. `print("Hello, " + name + "!")` — Show a message on screen

**Output:**
```
Hello, Alex!
```
