# Mini-Episode 1.2: Your First Program

> Write and run "Hello World" in Sona

## Script

### Intro (0:00 - 0:15)
"Time to write your very first program! This is an exciting moment."

### Create the File (0:15 - 1:00)
"Open VS Code and create a new file. Save it as `hello.sona` - the `.sona` part tells the computer it's a Sona program."

### Write the Code (1:00 - 2:30)
"Now type this exactly:"

```sona
print("Hello, World!")
```

"Let me break this down:
- `print` is a command that displays text
- The parentheses `()` hold what we want to print
- The quotes `""` surround the text
- Don't forget the exclamation point inside the quotes!"

### Run the Program (2:30 - 3:30)
"To run it, either:
1. Click the Run button in VS Code, or
2. Open terminal and type: `sona hello.sona`"

"You should see: `Hello, World!`"

"Congratulations! You just wrote a program!"

### Make it Yours (3:30 - 4:30)
"Now let's personalize it:"

```sona
print("Hello, World!")
print("My name is Alex")
print("I am learning Sona!")
```

"Change 'Alex' to YOUR name. Run it again."

### Outro (4:30 - 5:00)
"You did it! You're officially a programmer now. The `print` function will be your best friend as you learn. See you in the next episode where we learn about variables!"

## Visual Notes
- Show typing in real-time (slow!)
- Highlight each part of the code
- Show the output in terminal
- Celebration animation when it works

## Common Mistakes to Address
- Forgetting quotes
- Misspelling `print`
- Wrong file extension
- Capital P in print (it's lowercase!)
