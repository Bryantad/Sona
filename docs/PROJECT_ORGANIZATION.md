# Sona v0.5.1 Project Organization

This document outlines the reorganization of the Sona project structure for v0.5.1 to improve maintainability and organization.

## Organizational Changes

### 1. Directory Structure Improvements

- Created appropriate subdirectories for development files:

  - `development/fixes/` - For bug fix implementations
  - `development/patches/` - For version patch implementations
  - `development/archive/` - For archived development files

- Better organized test files:
  - `tests/backup/` - For test file backups
    - Categorized by test type (v0.5.0, function, minimal, etc.)
- Improved script organization:

  - `scripts/backup/` - For script backups
    - Categorized by purpose

- Enhanced documentation:
  - `docs/` - Consolidated documentation files
  - `docs/version_upgrades/` - Version-specific upgrade documentation

### 2. File Reorganization

- Moved test files from `backup_files/` to appropriate subdirectories in `tests/backup/`
- Moved fix/patch Python files to the proper development subdirectories
- Moved run scripts to `scripts/backup/` with proper categorization
- Relocated miscellaneous files from the root directory to their appropriate locations
- Created an archive of the original `backup_files/` directory for reference

### 3. Documentation Improvements

- Added README files to key directories explaining their purpose and structure
- Updated documentation to reflect the new organization
- Ensured consistent documentation format across the project

## Release Readiness

The project structure has been reorganized to support:

1. Easier navigation and file location
2. Better separation of development, testing, and documentation
3. Clearer organization for future development
4. Proper versioning and release management
